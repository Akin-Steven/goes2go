# Download Data
Download GOES 16 ABI (this example downloads the multichannel fixed grid product for CONUS) and read it with xarray.

```python
from goes2go.data import goes_latest, goes_nearesttime

# Get latest data
G1 = goes_latest(satellite='G16', product='ABI')

# Get data for a specific time
G2 = goes_nearesttime(datetime(2020,10,1), satellite='G16', product='GLM')
```

# RGB Recipies
For a GOES ABI multichannel xarray.Dataset, return an RGB array for an RGB product. See [DEMO](./notebooks/DEMO_rgb_recipies.ipynb) for more examples of RGB products.

# Field of View

See notebooks for [GLM](./notebooks/field-of-view_GLM.ipynb) and [ABI](./notebooks/field-of-view_ABI.ipynb) field of view.

GOES-West is centered over -137 W and GOES-East is centered over -75 W. When GOES was being tested, it was in a "central" position, outlined in the dashed black line. Below is the ABI field of view for the full disk:

The GLM field of view is slightly smaller and limited by a bounding box. Below is the GLM field of view:
