# âš™ Configure

The first time to import goes2go, it creates a configure file

```bash
~/.config/goes2go/config.confg
```

In this file, you may set the default directory files are downloaded to.
The default is
```
[download]
default_save_dir = /User/Home/Dir/data
```
If desired, update that path to set the default save directory.
