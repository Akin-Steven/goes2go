   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

These python functions can help you download GOES-R series NetCDF files from the `Amazon Web Services <https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-goes/>`_ archive.

Download Data
-------------
The following example downloads GOES 16 ABI multichannel file on the fixed grid for the CONUS domain and reads it with xarray for the latest image and an image nearest a specific time.

.. code-block:: python

   from goes2go.data import goes_latest, goes_nearesttime

   # Get latest data
   G1 = goes_latest(satellite='G16', product='ABI')

   # Get data for a specific time
   G2 = goes_nearesttime(datetime(2020,10,1), satellite='G16', product='GLM')

RGB Recipes
-----------
Generate RGB arrays for different RGB products. Check out this `notebook <https://github.com/blaylockbk/goes2go/blob/master/notebooks/DEMO_rgb_recipies.ipynb>`_ for a demonstration.

Field of View
-------------
See notebooks for `GLM <https://github.com/blaylockbk/goes2go/blob/master/notebooks/GLM_field-of-view.ipynb>`_ and `ABI <https://github.com/blaylockbk/goes2go/blob/master/notebooks/ABI_field-of-view.ipynb>`_ field of view.

GOES-West is centered over -137 W and GOES-East is centered over -75 W. When GOES was being tested, it was in a "central" position, outlined in the dashed black line. Below is the ABI field of view for the full disk:

The GLM field of view is slightly smaller and limited by a bounding box. The field of view can be estimated.
